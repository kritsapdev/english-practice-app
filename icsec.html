    <ul>
        <li>(S1) Good morning, distinguished committee members, honored guests, and all attendees.</li>
        <li>(S2) My name is Krisana Sapsinchai, from the Thai-Nichi Institute of Technology.</li>
        <li>(S3) Today, I am honored to present my research on the topic</li>
        <li>(S4) A Retrieval-Augmented Generation System for a Legal Advisory System in Thai Consumer Protection.</li>
        <li>(S5) The e-commerce market in Thailand has experienced exponential growth in recent years</li>
        <li>(S6) The retail and wholesale sector's value increased from 2.5 trillion baht in 2021 to over 2.8 trillion baht in 2023</li>
        <li>(S7) However, this rapid growth has led to a corresponding increase in consumer complaints</li>
        <li>(S8) particularly concerning exploitation by online sellers</li>
        <li>(S9) Unfortunately, accessing legal experts is often costly and time-consuming,</li>
        <li>(S10) leaving many consumers without the protection they rightfully deserve</li>
        <li>(S11) Therefore, this research aims to develop a preliminary advisory system</li>
        <li>(S12) for Thai consumer protection law to serve as a guide and bridge this accessibility gap.</li>
        <li>(S13) Our system utilizes Generative AI technology</li>
        <li>(S14) with its core being a technique called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</li>
        <li>(S15) This approach is fundamentally different from the conventional fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs).</li>
        <li>(S16) Why RAG?. The primary advantage of RAG. is its ability. to mitigate the problem of Hallucination.</li>
        <li>(S17) where the AI generates incorrect. or fabricated information.</li>
        <li>(S18) The system first "Retrieves" information from a curated Knowledge Base we have prepared</li>
        <li>(S19) Then, it "Generates" an answer based exclusively on the retrieved data.</li>
        <li>(S20) This ensures that the answers are reliable and legally accurate.</li>
        <li>(S21) Furthermore, if there are new legal updates, they can be quickly integrated into the system.</li>
        <li>(S22) Our process began with Dataset Collection. We gathered data from two primary sources</li>
    </ul>
